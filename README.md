# CMSC 127, Group 2, MS-DOS: Final Project

- Install `npm` or `pnpm` or your package manager of choice.
- Run `npm update`.
- Make sure MariaDB/MySQL is running, and the SQL dump file (`docs/source.sql`) is imported.
- Configure/modify the `.env` file at the `/api` subdirectory for your configuration (e.g., user and password credentials).
- Open two separate instances of the terminal:
    * (a) run `npm dev` to start the front-end server.
    * (b) `cd` to the `api` directory, and run `npm start` to start the API server.
- Navigate to the link in the terminal of the front-end server (this is usually http://localhost:5173/).
